# CTA-Application
Final Project for college CS 201 course (OOP in Java)

## Description

A program that models the Chiacgo CTA (rail lines) and allows users to interact with the data it contains.
The goal is to demonstrate knowledge about objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and lists and using them to model various systems.

## Technologies

Object-oriented programming in Java

## Running

Project is in .Java files. The "main" method is in CTAApplication.Java 

## Features

1. Implement a user-friendly command-line interface.
2. Completely handle errors in user input.
3. Read CTA stations from csv files, and allow a user to export them to cta as well.
4. Allow a user to create a new station that is then added to the CTA.
5. Allow a user to modify an existing station on the CTA.
6. Allow a user to remove a station from the CTA.
7. Allow a user to search for a station within the CTA, and handle no or multiple results..
8. Allow a user to search for a station given requirements for the station (wheelchair access or be on certain lines...)
9. Find the nearest station within the CTA when given a latitude and longitude by the user.
10. Generate a path between any two stations, and handle stations that are not on the same line and indicate to the user where to switch from one line to another.
11. Generate a path between any two GeoLocations by using the CTA network.
12. Exit when the user requests to finish.
